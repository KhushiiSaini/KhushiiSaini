### Hi there 👋, I am Khushii Saini, a third year Computer Student at McMaster University.

<!--
**KhushiiSaini/KhushiiSaini** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
- 🏢 During the summer of 2023, I completed an internship at McMaster University, under the IT department of Security Services as a Project Support Assistant. I had the opportunity to create impressive data analysis reports and dashboards for the department. I'm currently continuing my work in the same department, now in a part-time capacity.
- 💹 I'm interested in pursuing a career in data science or software development.
- 🧩 I love working on side projects/completing certifications for enhancing my knowledge.
